            <ul>
                <li>Create more content for this page.</li>
                <li>Debug my first Java application with Eclipse: Finished and approved by a professional jury.</li>
                <li>Create a morse translator that will be integrated to this page.</li>
                <li>Have fun! Learning how to code opens so many possibilities. One should never forget to enjoy what he does!</li>
